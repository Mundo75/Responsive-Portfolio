                    <p class="p1">Jeff Raimundo is a self proclaimed Aviation Geek with Googling aspirations. Born in on the mean streets of
                        Butte MT, to a family of would be pilots and life-long airline employees, he did the natural thing and sought a
                        degree in history on a football scholarship. After graduation, he was shocked to realized that the streets were not
                        paved with gold for a beer swilling historian.</p>
                    <p class="p1">Shortly after he packed up the pick-up, grabbed is dog and hit the road headed for Arizona. There he
                        attended Arizona State University in the Aeronautical Flight Management program and started his career as
                        professional pilot and Airline employee.</p>
                    <p class="p1">After 20 or so years working for various airlines and aviation companies, I am looking to supplement my
                        skills with coding.</p>
